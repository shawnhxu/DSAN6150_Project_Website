As a reminder, a syndemic is a “set of intertwined and mutually enhancing epidemics involving disease interactions at the biological level that develop and are sustained in a community/population because of harmful social conditions and injurious social connections.”1 Our analysis found that, at the significance level of 0.05, 15 variables had a significant impact on age informed of diabetes.

As there are almost 40 different factors explored, we decided to pick 5 that were of interest to us and/or mentioned in our literature review. The factors that we selected were: alcohol consumption, depression, access to health care, insurance status, and occupation. Alcohol is a prominent social behaviour that we thought would be interesting to explore in conjunction to diabetes as it is a integrated part of every culture. Depression appeared frequently in our literature review and we wanted to explore if there is any relationship between diabetes and depression within this data set. Access to health care and insurance status are related, and both are vital to diabetes treatment, which is why we decided to include them. Finally, we were curious about if employment status and how much someone works has any relationship with diabetes status, which is why we selected it as our final variable. The variables that weren’t selected are by no means of lesser importance to diabetes than the ones we chose. We selected only a few because we wanted to focus on a few variables in depth to get a comprehensive picture, rather than hastily exploring almost 40 variables.\nEach one of the five subtopics is its own data set and has a series of individual questions within it. The alcohol data set explores general alcohol consumption behaviours, as well as quantifying how much alcohol someone consumes on average. The depression data set explores different specific feelings or states someone with depression may experience, such as difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, little will to do anything, etc. The access to health care explores how accessible health care is to the respondent including whether or not they have someone to go to receive health care regularly, and how frequently they receive health care. The insurance data set explores insurance coverage including general coverage, and what specific type of insurance an individual may have. Finally, the occupation data set explores topics such as job status, type of job, and how many hours the respondent works per week. All of these data sets have many variables and we were not able to explore all of them. Many of the variables are similar in nature and are quite specific. For example, in the alcohol data set, there are multiple questions about if the respondent has had 8+ drinks per day, and then another about whether they’ve had 6+ drinks per day. We felt that these variables didn’t provide as much information as some of the other ones, such as whether or not they’ve ever consumed alcohol or the average number of drinks per day. Therefore, for each data set, we selected a few variables that we felt summarised the topic effectively."

The survival curves cross multiple times indicating that we are not able to tell if consumption of alcohol at least once in the respondent’s life has any relationship with when they are informed of their diabetes. This makes sense as “ever having a drink of alcohol” is quite a broad category. Some people in this category may only try alcohol once and never have it again, while others may drink every day. This prompted us to further explore alcohol consumption by looking at the average number of drinks per day over one year’s time span.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nAverage Alcoholic Drinks Per Day Past 12 Months\n0.04231258\n0.01955076\n2.164242\n0.03044579\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Cox Regression model and the Kaplan-Meier curves show us different results. When we look at the Cox Regression model, we see an overall p-value of 0.03, which would make the relationship between consumption of alcohol and diabetes diagnosis statistically significant. However, when we look at the Kaplan-Meier curve, we do not see a statistically significant result between groups.\nIt is also important to consider that the statistical results in the Kaplan-Meier curve could be due to the number of people in each of the drinks groups as the larger number of drinks per day group may be a smaller sample size than groups where people have fewer drinks per day, which is worth exploring. We saw in the EDA section that 80% of the respondents to this questions fell in the 1-3 drinks categories, and another 10% fell in the 4-6 drinks categories. As a reminder, below we can see the table of counts by group of number of drinks consumed per day. We can see that there are many more people per group in the fewer number of drinks per day categories than in the greater number of drinks per day categories. We cannot be certain that this difference in numbers is solely responsible for the low p_value, but it is important to keep in mind when interpreting this analysis.\n\nTable I: Average Number of Drinks per Day Past 12 Months Counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Drinks\nCount\n\n\n\n\n1\n1996\n\n\n2\n1732\n\n\n3\n829\n\n\n4\n427\n\n\n5\n229\n\n\n6\n200\n\n\n7\n44\n\n\n8\n64\n\n\n9\n13\n\n\n10\n42\n\n\n11\n3\n\n\n12\n53\n\n\n13\n3\n\n\n15\n29"

    "text": "Diabetes & Depression Analysis\nFor the diabetes and depression analysis, we selected four columns that we felt summarised many of the symptoms experienced by someone with depression: little interest in doing things, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, feeling bad about yourself, and poor appetite or overeating. We want to acknowledge that, of course, these are not the only things that people with depression experience. Depression is a very dynamic and complicated condition that everyone experiences differently. We are unable to explore every aspect of it, so for the sake of our analysis, we chose a few variables that we thought were representative.\n\nLittle Interest in Doing Things\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nLittle Interest in Doing Things: More than half the days\n0.11755932\n0.1261548\n0.9318654\n0.3514061\n\n\nLittle Interest in Doing Things: Not at all\n0.06391273\n0.1402434\n0.4557271\n0.6485863\n\n\nLittle Interest in Doing Things: Several days\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere didn’t seem to be any significant different in age informed of diabetes between groups who did not experience decreased interest in doing things, and those who did.\n\n\nFeeling Down, Depressed, or Hopeless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nFeeling Down, Depressed, or Hopeless: Not at all\n-0.003496079\n0.1425141\n-0.02453146\n0.98042869\n\n\nFeeling Down, Depressed, or Hopeless: Several days\n0.303967538\n0.1353904\n2.24511846\n0.02476053\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Kaplan-Meier curve did not show a statistically significant relationship between feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and being diagnosed with diabetes, the Cox Regression model did for people who felt down, depressed, or hopeless on several days. The Kaplan-Meier curve was close to showing significance as it had a p-value of 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05. Because of the Cox Regression model showing significance, this variable will remain one of interest for our further analysis.\n\n\nFeeling Bad About Yourself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nFeeling Bad About Yourself: More than half the days\n0.3277865\n0.1802633\n1.818377\n0.069006585\n\n\nFeeling Bad About Yourself: Not at all\n0.6007222\n0.1627676\n3.690674\n0.000223661\n\n\nFeeling Bad About Yourself: Several days\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves show that feeling bad about yourself does have a statistically significant relationship with age of diagnosis, with people who feel bad about themselves more than half the days tending to be diagnosed earlier and those who do not feel bad about themselves tending to be diagnosed later. This indicates an association with this symptom of depression and diabetes diagnosis.\n\n\nPoor Appetite or Overeating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nPoor Appetite or Overeating: Several days\n0.1020960\n0.1267995\n0.8051771\n0.4207175\n\n\nPoor Appetite or Overeating: More than half the days\n-0.1119409\n0.1423234\n-0.7865247\n0.4315601\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor appetite or overeating was not found to have a statistically significant impact on age informed of diabetes. Overall, two out of the four markers of depression that we decided to analyse seem to have a significant relationship with diabetes. For all questions in the questionnaire analysis, but particularly to the depression related questions, it is important to consider that this data was gathered through a survey and is susceptible to response bias. For many individuals, depression is a sensitive topic that they may be hesitant to report or be honest about in a survey due to social and internalized stigma. There were only between 300-400 responses per question, which only a small fraction of the data set and respondents, and therefore is likely the reason that this analysis does not find statistical significance between type II diabetes and depression when much of the literature does."

The p-values associated with each variable, derived from log-rank tests, were annotated on the visualizations to evaluate the statistical significance of the relationship between the categorical variable and survival time.\nAmong the categorical variables analyzed, diet healthiness and provision of community meals by the governemnt demonstrated the most statistically significant associations with survival time, yielding a p-values of p &lt; 0.001. These results suggest that the observed differences in survival distributions across dietary healthiness groups and communities that are provided with government meals are unlikely to occur by random chance, providing strong evidence for a relationship between these factors and the development of diabetes. Whether schools served lunches or not also had a significant effect of p = 0.002. Finally, education Thad a significant albeid moderate p value of p = o.042. This analysis suggests that the aforementioned variables may be risk factors for the development of diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous variables were analyzed similarly by first transforming them into ‘categorical’ variables. This was achieved through binning, where each continuous variable was divided into five equally sized buckets (quintiles). The binning process allows for the application of survival analysis methods, which are designed for categorical predictors. This approach provides a practical way to assess the relationship between continuous variables and survival outcomes while preserving interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the continuous variables were found to have an association with the development of diabetes."

In the next few cells, this data frame is read and processed to prepare it for survival analysis. Categorical variables are ready for analysis. A list of these is created. Continuous variables are also put into a list, as these will require slightly more processing for the survival analysis to be conducted.\n\n\n  respondent_sequence_num

These results suggest that the observed differences in survival distributions across dietary healthiness groups and communities that are provided with government meals are unlikely to occur by random chance, providing strong evidence for a relationship between these factors and the development of diabetes. Whether schools served lunches or not also had a significant effect of p = 0.002. Finally, education Thad a significant albeid moderate p value of p = o.042.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe current condition of the United States medical system and public health policies leaves little room to address underlying factors that create adverse health conditions for many Americans. Consequently, elements that amplify disease symptoms and progression for certain populations, such as socioeconomic class, immigration status, climate conditions, political stability, and more, are overlooked. It is in these overlooked populations where synergistic epidemics, or syndemics, emerge. A syndemic is a “set of intertwined and mutually enhancing epidemics involving disease interactions at the biological level that develop and are sustained in a community/population because of harmful social conditions and injurious social connections.”1 These health conditions can be direct influences such as medical comorbidities, or less apparent relationships like mental health status impacting a non-communicable disease. Investigating such relationships and causal chains is vital to preventing the development of more serious diseases and novel epidemics.\nResearch of syndemics aims to specifically highlight the role of these previously overlooked factors by addressing how such latent variables impact disease progression and development. Though vital, syndemics are a historically understudied topic in epidemiological research due to their complicated nature, which involves numerous situational permutations and confounding variables. Research on syndemics is crucial, as syndemics often affect more vulnerable populations including impoverished individuals, individuals in emerging and developing countries, and those with limited access to adequate healthcare.\nThe term “syndemic” was first defined by Merrill Singer, a medical anthropologist, who used it to describe the interaction between drug abuse, violence, and AIDS that formed an epidemic in Connecticut in the 1990s.2 As described by Singer, the three main concepts that construct a syndemic are: disease concentration, disease interaction, and the societal dynamics that cause them.3 Eventually, these three elements led to the syndemic theory that socioeconomic inequality can lead to the co-occurrence of two or more epidemics.4 While the syndemic framework is used in the field today, there remain detractors who argue that it is not supported by sufficiently thorough analytical processes.5 We plan to further explore syndemic theory, statistical methods for syndemic analysis, and type II diabetes syndemics by identifying what type II diabetes syndemics literature exists, identifying where there are gaps in the research, and proposing areas for future study that will guide our associated data analysis project."

    "text": "Methods\nThis review aims to concentrate on papers related to syndemics that include a data analysis component. To conduct this literature review, we read free articles drawn from open-access databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed that easily and quickly compile results for users. We also explored humanities databases, such as JSTOR and EBSCO, but they proved less relevant to this topic. The topics of the selected articles fall into three categories: syndemics in a general sense or syndemics unrelated to diabetes, the various diabetes syndemics, or general associations between diabetes and external confounding variables, but not in the context of a syndemic. Papers from all three categories have been included so we can learn about analysis methods and the relationship between diabetes syndemics from all of them.\nArticles were included in this review if they were related to syndemics or diabetes, they contained a data analysis component, and/or information on the association between diabetes and other variables. Articles were excluded if they were merely a literature review or if they were behind a paywall. This is not to say that literature review articles or articles behind paywalls are of less importance than articles that were free to access; rather, that the article did not fit the inclusion criteria, or the cost was outside of the scope of our resources for this project, respectively.\nTwenty-one articles were selected for this literature review. Five were excluded on the grounds of being a literature review or containing no data analysis, but the findings regarding the syndemic framework and associations between diabetes and external variables, such as depression, were taken into consideration when deciding the direction of our project and conducting our analysis. One was excluded for being behind a paywall. Ultimately, fifteen articles were reviewed. The papers included in this review were published between 1996 and 2023."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nAnalysis Methods\nIn order to conduct our analysis in the most efficient way that is consistent with the existing literature, we first wanted to focus on the methods used by existing studies. Twelve of the fifteen included papers contained a data analysis component and a variety of methods were used. The most popular method by far, with five studies utilizing it, was multinomial logistic regression.6 The next most popular methods were all utilized by two studies each, and were prevalence and odds ratio,7 applied weights for sampling methods and non-response,8 and cross-sectional household surveys.9 Finally, methods only utilized by one study included frequency tables,10 generalized linear models with Huber-White confidence interval estimations,11 the association rule mining algorithm ECLAT,12 significant values,13 chi-squared statistics,14 and tests of homogeneity of variance.15\n\n\nDiabetes and Environmental Variables\nNine of the fifteen included articles specifically discussed the diabetes and depression syndemic or the associations between diabetes and depression. Three studies came to conclusions about the relationship between diabetes and depression. Roy and Llyod concluded that the prevalence of depression is almost four times higher in those with type I diabetes (12% versus 3.2% respectively), and twice as high in those with type II diabetes (19.1% versus 10.7% respectively).16 Anderson et al. concluded that the odds of depression in their diabetic group were twice those of the non-diabetic group (OR = 2.0).17 Finally, De Groot et al. concluded that there is a significant association between depression and the complications of diabetes (p &lt; 0.00001).18\nMany of the articles came to consistent conclusions regarding the underlying psychosocial factors that amplify the effects of diabetes and/or depression. In their 2018 paper, Diderichsen and Andersen highlighted that diabetes and depression share common causes, including age, shorter education, lower income, higher stress, physical inactivity, and obesity.19 These factors are among those frequently named by other authors as factors that amplified diabetes and depression, as well as adverse childhood events, ethnic discrimination, gender, and exposure to violence. McCurley et al. concluded that individuals with a lower household income, who had adverse childhoods, those who have experienced ethnic discrimination, and have had exposure to violence in the past year, had higher odds of diabetes and depression comorbidities (odds ratio [OR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: (2.89, 7.33); 1.31, 95% CI: (1.16, 1.71); 1.23, 95% CI: (1.01, 1.50); and 1.53, 95% CI: (1.30, 1.80), respectively).20 In their 2018 study using a survey of over 80,000 Brazilian households, Diderichsen and Andersen concluded that 546 people, or 0.91% of their total study population, reported having both diabetes and depression, “which is 1.85 times higher than expected if the conditions were not clustering.”21 In their 2021 study they conducted with Mathisen, they went on to conclude that the prevalence of diabetes is 6.2% strongly associated with lower education levels and higher age, and prevalence of depression is 7.9% strongly associated with the same factors.22 Saxena and Mendenhall corroborated these findings by stating that the lowest-income communities included in their study of income groups in India and China faced compounded social stress, untreated depression, and poor access to healthcare as well as clustered health conditions.23\nLastly, three studies concluded that women experience more risk of depression than men do, which plays an underlying role in depression as a comorbidity of diabetes. In their 2015 study, Mendenhall et al. concluded that women in the scope of their study experienced greater social suffering and mental distress compared to men.24 Roy and Lloyd agreed and stated that women generally with and without diabetes experience higher rates of depression than men.25 Finally, Anderson et al. focused specifically on men and women with diabetes, and concluded that the prevalence of comorbid depression was significantly higher in diabetic women than in diabetic men (28% versus 18%, respectively).26\n\n\nSyndemic Framework\nFourteen of the fifteen included articles were in support of the idea of a syndemic and made cases for their importance and prevalence in current health conditions; one, however, was a bit more sceptical. In his 2018 paper entitled “Syndemics: A theory in search of data or data in search of a theory,” Tsai refutes the idea of a syndemic, claiming that the method of analysis used by many existing syndemic studies is forging relationships within the data. He claims that other studies are using a “sum score specification” which involves summing the “total health risks experienced by study participants, and this variable is then included in a regression model,” which leads to inaccurate data analysis.27 He doesn’t completely refute the idea of syndemics, stating that they “remain important opportunities to investigate how epidemics interact both at the level of populations and at the level of individuals,” rather aims to open the discussion for how analysis of syndemic data can be more effective.28"

    "text": "Discussion\nSyndemics describe the phenomenon where two or more epidemics meet or emerge in communities and are aggravated by underlying psychosocial factors, such as socioeconomic status, poverty status, immigration status, environmental health, political circumstances, and more. Analysis of syndemics is complicated due to the number of permutations and confounding variables, but popular statistical methods include multinomial logistic regression, prevalence and odds ratios, applied weights for sampling methods and non-response, cross-sectional surveys, chi-squared statistics, frequency tables, the association rule mining algorithm ECLAT, and more. Studies of the general associations between diabetes and environmental variables as well as the diabetes and depression syndemic revealed that the prevalence of depression is significantly higher in those with diabetes than in those without, and is much higher in women than in men. These studies also revealed that the morbidities of diabetes are amplified by adverse childhood events, ethnic discrimination, exposure to violence in the past year, gender, shorter education, and lower income. Finally, this review of the literature also revealed an opposer to the analysis methods currently used in syndemic research, stating that studies are using the ‘sum score’ model where all of a participants’ health risks are recorded, summed, and used in a regression model, which does not lead to an accurate representation of the relationships between certain risk factors and the outcome.\nSSyndemic research, particularly on diabetes syndemics, still has a long way to go. There are many areas for future research in the diabetes syndemics. First, there are many countries where extensive syndemic research, particularly on the diabetes and depression syndemic, has not been conducted. Second, the most effective and representative statistical analysis method has yet to be decided on. Finally, there is little information on what governments and individuals can do to combat syndemics. Future research in these areas would be beneficial to the syndemic field."

    "text": "Primary Dataset\nOur primary source of data comes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) which was conducted by the Center of Disease Control (CDC). The NHANES survey uses interviews and examinations to assess the health and nutritional status of people in the United States.\nIn this project we used the data collected between 2017 to March 2020. NHANES operations were suspended in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic causing the 2019-2020 data collection cycle to not be completed so the 2019 - March 2020 data was combined with 2017 - 2018 data.\nThe NHANES data contains surveys on demographics, dietary behavior, physical exam, laboratory data, and questionnaire data. The records across the data sets are linked by a sequence number (SEQN) that uniquely identifies each participant and allows the data to be merged for analysis. The data files are available in SAS Transport files in the .xpt format which we will convert to csv files for our analysis.\n\nDiabetes Data\nThe diabetes data file has 14,989 records of 28 columns which include whether or not the subject has been diagnosed with type II diabetes and the age at which they were informed as well as many variables on medical treatment and medication information.\n\n\nDemographics Data\nThe demographics data file has 15,560 records of 29 columns including gender, race, age, birth country, education level, family income, marital and pregnancy status, and several columns with information on how the survey was conducted.\n\n\nDiet Data\nThe diet behavior data file has 15,560 records of 46 columns. Columns include variables such as frequency of meals from fast food place, from frozen meals, from community centers, etc. as well as measures of diet healthiness.\n\n\nLaboratory Data\nThe laboratory exam data file has 13,594 records of 338 columns. The columns include variables from many different physiological tests.\n\n\nQuestionnaire Data\nThe questionnaire data file has 24,369 records of 232 columns. These columns include variables on alcohol use, depression, healthcare access, health insurance coverage, and occupation."

    "text": "To determine the demographic factors that have an association with type II diabetes diagnosis we looked at several variables in the NHANES demographic data file. The demographics data file had 8 demographic variables of the 29 columns in the dataframe. Of these 8, we chose to exclude age, marital status, and pregnancy status. We excluded marital status and pregnancy status because they do not necessarily remain the same before and after a hypothetical diabetes development. The remaining variables that we did examine were gender, race, country of birth, education level, and family income level.\nWe generated Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each of these variables with the event being diabetes diagnosis and the time to event being the age at which the subject was diagnosed. Of the five variables, we found a significant difference in survival for race, gender, family income and education level at the p = 0.05 significance level. There was no significant difference in survival based on country of birth.\n\n\n\nOf the Dietary variables explored from NHANES, only a handful yielded survival p values that would suggest a significant relationship. Both government provision of community meals as well as the dietary health index yielded p values of less than 0.001. Interestingly, the trend of socially provided meals continued with a p value of 0.002 for whether or not the school provided lunch. Another significant relationship was found in the attending of kindergarten through high school, albeit moderately less so, with a p value of 0.042. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the patterns in the data would be observed if there was not a relationship between these variables and the likeliness and timing of developing diabetes, especially with regard to extremely low p values. This suggests that there might be some relationship between dietary health, social meal support, education, and the development of diabetes. These four variables where therefore selected for the investigation of syndemics. It is also possible that confounding variables exist, such as socioeconomic status, which could impact dietary health directly via the ability to purchase food, and diabetes status via access to care. Further research and data collection would be needed to establish causality on existing variables and on confounding variables.\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to associate physiological measurements to the development of diabetes, we decided to include the NHANES Laboratory data set which was a part of the main NHANES data source. The Laboratory Dataset included more than 40 different physiological tests which resulted in 13,000+ rows and 338 features.\nTo identify key features influencing diabetes development, we fitted Cox Proportional Hazards models for each feature in the merged laboratory dataset. Statistically significant features were selected based on p-values and hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were then generated, with annotated p-values highlighting relationships between physiological features and survival time.\nAmong the analyzed features, only LBDBANO (Basophils number (1000 cell/uL)) showed a statistically significant difference in survival analysis across basophils volume ranges. Basophils are white blood cells and they play a key role in fighting off infections, parasites, and allergens. According to research, an increased volume of white blood cells is heavily associated to the etiology of diabetes. Therefore, with a larger volume of Basophils, there might be an increase risk of developing type 2 Diabetes.\n\n\n\nThe questionnaire data section of the NHANES data set provided an overview of import social, environmental, and external health factors that could impact a diabetes diagnosis. Over the almost 40 variables in the questionnaire data set, we decided to focus on five: alcohol consumption, depression, access to health care, insurance coverage, and occupation. These variables are prominent in many cultures and/or were mentioned in our review of the literature which is why we felt they were important to explore. As mentioned in other parts of the questionnaire analysis, each of these variables is an individual data set with multiple different variables. Some of the variables are quite specific, so we selected the few variables that are most representative or are the best at summarising that variable.\nFor each analysis, similarly to the laboratory data, we fitted Cox Proportional Hazards models for each features and then created Kaplan-Meier curves to show how survival probability changes over time. We found six significant variables: general health condition, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, feeling bad about yourself, employment status, hours worked last week, and the average number of drinks per day over the past year. These variables came from all of the sub-data sets, except for the insurance data. There were variables that were consistent in our minds, such as people with poorer general health conditions being diagnosed earlier, and those who drink more being diagnosed earlier, as diabetes is a disease related to blood sugar. We were interested in seeing that the depression variables were significant as this was consistent with much of the research that we reviewed. Finally, employment status and hours worked can affect access to health care and food, which many impact general health.\n\n\n\nOnce each individual analysis was done, our next step was combining the variables to see how the influence each other. There were fifteen significant variables. As this number would produce a very large amount of combinations, we decided to analyse the variables with the highest significance (i.e. those with p &lt; 0.001). We ended up analysing eight variables. To analyse these combinations, we wrote a function to loop through every combination of the variables and fit each one to a Cox Proportional Hazards model with an interaction term. The variable combination and the p value of the interaction term were recorded in a data frame.\nThere were four significant combinations. There were three variables, the ratio of household income to the poverty line, diet healthiness, and and community government meals delivered, that seemed to be closely related in terms of access to healthy food and food in general. Lower household income may mean that individuals may not be able to afford healthier options for food, as it is often more expensive than more processed food, and may rely on community or government programs for food assistance. The other significant variable that came up in the interactions was the number of Basophils that someone has. An increased number of basophils, as mentioned above, is associated with the underlying causes of diabetes, so it is not unusual to see this variable in the significant variables. This analysis turned up a lot of NA values in combinations that involve the other 5 significant variables, which is likely due to lack of data or small sample sizes."

Names and summaries of each of the variables are shown below.\n\nMissing Values\nThe data set has 682 missing values for the age variable and 2201 missing values for the ratio_family_income_poverty variable.\n\n\nDistribution of Continuous Variables\nThere are two continuous variables in the demographics data set: age and family income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of ages present in the survey is a bit skewed with higher numbers of younger people ( &lt;20 years old) than any other age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) poverty guidelines were used as the poverty measure to calculate this ratio. So, the ratio was calculated as:\nRatio = (Total Annual Income)/(Poverty Guideline specific to each year)\nThe survey had a higher number of participants at five times or greater the poverty line than any other level.\n\n\nDistribution of Categorical Variables\nThere are several categorical variables in the demographics data set that may have associations with higher rates of diabetes diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of survey participants were born in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of survey participants have at least a high school diploma, but the numbers are fairly similar across all five levels of education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-hispanic black and non-hispanic white are the two most frequent races present in the survey sample.\n\n\nGender and Education Stratified by Race\nTo understand how confounding variables may affect our analysis, it is important to compare the distributions of various factors such as gender and education level by other demographic factors such as race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gender distribution is fairly even across all races in the survey sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation levels, on the other hand, do differ across different races. Therefore education and race may be confounders in analysis of the survey data."

This dataset contains 28 variables which include when participants were diagnosed, whether or not they are on insulin, how frequently they see a doctor, etc. Names and summaries of each of the variables are shown below.\n\nMissing Values\nThere are missing values in the age_informed, insulin_length, num_dr_visits_past_year, and how_often_glucose_check variables. These missing values are likely for participants who have not been informed of a diabetes diagnosis.\n\n\nDistribution of Diagnostic Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of participants in the survey have not been informed of any signs of type II diabetes diagnosis. To understand some characteristics of the survey participants who have been diagnosed, we filtered the data to include only these participants and looked at the distribution of some key variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of participants who have been diagnosed with type II diabetes were informed of this diagnosis between the ages of 40 and 70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong type II diabetics, about one third of participants were taking insulin at the time of the survey.\n\n\nDistribution of Variables Related to Disease Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany type II diabetics check their glucose levels 0-1 times per day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost type II diabetics visit the doctor between 1 and 5 times per year.\n\n\nDistribution of Variables Related to Disease Monitoring based on Severity of Disease (indicated by whether of not the participant is on insulin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used whether or not the participant takes insulin as an indicator of the severity of disease to look at the distribution of glucose checks based on disease severity. Excluding some outlying data points at very high frequencies of glucose checks, we see a general trend of participants who checked their glucose more frequently were more likely to be taking insulin and therefore more likely to have severe disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same pattern does not hold true when looking at doctor visit frequencies. The columns representing very high ( &gt;15) counts of doctors visits were almost completely made up of participants who are taking insulin. In the columns representing lower counts of doctors visits per year there does not seem to be a large difference in the proportion of participants who are taking insulin."

    "section": "Questionnaire Data",
    "text": "Questionnaire Data\nThe NHANES questionnaire data set has over 40 different variables regarding social behaviours, employment status, mental health, physical health, insurance coverage, and more. For the sake of getting a comprehensive analysis, we have selected the five factors that we want to explore further. The factors are alcohol consumption, depression, health access, insurance, and occupation. These factors pique our interest the most and/or were mentioned frequently in our review of the literature. Each of these factors is a sub-data set with multiple variables. These variables can be a general overview of the topic, such as the alcohol data set’s question “have you have consumed alcohol,” or quite specific, such as the alcohol data set’s question “how many days have you consumed 12+ drinks in the past year.” We have decided to select variables that we believed were the most representative of the subject and could give us the best overview of the respondent’s behaviour without going into the specifics for each question. We have selected 1-4 variables per sub-topic and these are the variables that we have performed EDA and survival analysis. Our selection of these variables is not to say that other variables are less important, rather we want to focus on variables that provide the most information possible.\n\nAlcohol Data\nFor the alcohol data set, there were many questions about specific alcohol consumption behaviours, such as the questions mentioned above. We have selected two variables for this section: ever_had_a_drink_of_any_kind_of_alcohol and avg_alcoholic_drinks_per_day_past_12_months. We have cleaned the data to remove any outliers and then performed exploratory data analysis.\n\nGeneral Alcohol Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the respondents’ answer to “ever had a drink of any kind of alcohol” shows that 89.6% of respondents have consumed alcohol before, and 10.4% have not. We next want to explore how much those who have consumed alcohol tend to consume on average.\n\n\nHow Much Alcohol Consumed Per Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find that a majority of the respondents are having between 1-3 drinks per day. Those three groups encompass approximately 80% of the data. Individuals reporting 4-6 drinks per day make up another 10% of the results, and those having 7+ drinks per day make up the other 10%.\n\n\n\nDepression Data\nFor the depression data, we decided to explore all of the variables in the data set. Each variable formats the question similarly, asking how many days have you felt ___ and has the same set of answer choices: “not at all”, “several days”, and “more than half the days.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn every question asked in the depression questionnaire, most than half of the time, the respondent said not at all. The “feeling tired or having little energy” and “trouble sleeping or sleeping too much” say higher proportions of “several days” and “more than half the days” responses. The next highest not-at-all to other answers ratio was in “poor appetite or overeating”, and the other questions are all fairly even.\n\n\nHealth Insurance Data\nWe decided to explore two variables from the health insurance data, which are whether or not the respondent is covered by insurance and if so, what kind of insurance do they have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovered by Insurance?\nCount\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nYes\n13671\n0.8785989717\n\n\nNo\n1852\n0.1190231362\n\n\nDon't know\n29\n0.0018637532\n\n\nRefused\n8\n0.0005141388\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that around 87.9% of the respondents were covered by insurance, and 11.9% percent were not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance Type\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nCovered by CHIP\n15389\n171\n\n\nCovered by Medigap\n15462\n98\n\n\nCovered by Medicard\n11381\n4179\n\n\nCovered by Medicare\n12968\n2592\n\n\nCovered by Other Government Insurance\n14552\n1008\n\n\nCovered by Private Insurance\n8457\n7103\n\n\nCovered by State Sponsored Health Plan\n14623\n937\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also founds that the most popular type of insurance was private insurance, followed by medicaid, medicare, and other types of government insurance.\n\n\nAccess to Healthcare and Hospital Usage Data\nFor the access to health care and hospital usage data, we decided to look at two variables: general health care conditions, and whether or not respondents have a regular place to go to for health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespondents reported that they were generally in good health condition, followed by very good and then excellent conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost respondents also have a consistent place to go to for health care, such as an urgent care or primary care physician.\n\n\nOccupation Data\nFinally, for the occupation data set we wanted to explore how much people are working and what their job status is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph we can learn the vast majority of the respondents are working 35-40 hours per week, followed by 45-50 hours, then 40-45 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA majority of the respondents are working at a job or business, followed by a good proportion of those who are out of work."

    "text": "It is no secret that the United States medical system has lots of room for improvement. It tends to focus more on treating symptoms rather than addressing underlying causes, an approach that disproportionately benefits populations in positions of privilege who have more physical and financial access to health care. Additionally, most medical research and literature overlooks racial and gender minorities, which creates fundamental barriers to developing universal, equitable healthcare by overlooking how health can manifest differently in populations who are affected by different variables. These shortcomings highlight the need for a more inclusive and preventative healthcare system that addresses the root causes of health disparities.\nIn particular, the medical system and public health policies in the United States have failed to adequately account for the environmental, social, and economic factors that significantly impact health outcomes. Socioeconomic status, gender, immigration status, climate change, and political systems all contribute to the severity of health conditions, often exacerbating existing health crises. This overlap of factors can lead to what is known as a “syndemic,” which is a situation where multiple health conditions overlap and intensify within a population. These conditions may include direct co-morbidities or less obvious influences, such as how societal and environmental factors worsen non-communicable diseases like diabetes.\nSyndemic research is a relatively new field, particularly in the United States, and our project seeks to contribute to this emerging area of study. Our project is divided into two parts: a comprehensive literature review and a data analysis. We aim to explore the syndemic between type II diabetes and depression in the United States, focusing on the underlying factors that amplify diabetes. The literature suggests that depression and immigration status are key syndemic factors. Our literature review will delve deeper into these factors, guiding our subsequent research."

    "text": "In an attempt to associate physiological measurements to the development of diabetes, we decided to include the NHANES Laboratory Dataset which were a part of the main NHANES data source. The Laboratory Dataset included more than 40 different physiological tests which resulted in 13,000+ rows and 338 features. Additionally, we left merged with the diabetes dataset to include the event and time-to-event which added 2 more features resulting in 340 features in the final survival analysis dataset.\nTo investigate the most notable features that have the most significant impact in the development of diabetes, we fitted multiple Cox Proportional Hazards model for each feature from the merged laboratory dataset. We then took the most statistically significant and highly impactful features through given p-values and Hazard Ratios from the fitted Cox models. Finally, we generated Kaplan-Meier survival curves and annotated p-values associated to the relationships of the physiological features and survival time onto each plot.\n\n\n\nThe cleaned laboratory testing data is imported here and further cleaned. We noticed the diabetes dataset that we will use for our time and event included numerous rows of empty values which we replaced with NA here. Additionally, for the sake of cleanliness and efficiency we have decided to replace “yes” and “borderline” values of being diagnosed with type II diabetes to 1 with other values being replaced with 0. Finally, to utilize the diabetes data with our laboratory data we left merged the diabetes dataset with the cleaned laboratory dataset.\n\n\n\nWith more than 300 features in the laboratory data, we decided to sift through them all by fitting univariate Cox Proportional Hazard models on each feature. This will find all features that provide significant impact in time to event. More specifically, we will save the p-value and hazard ratio of each Cox model to a data frame which helps describe the impact of each feature on time-to-event. We then take the top features with the highest statistical significance (lowest p-values) and strongest impact (highest absolute HR values) on the event to do survival analysis.\n\n\n\nThis step takes a look at the top 100 features with the lowest p-values from the saved data frame of extracted p-values and hazard ratio values.

    "text": "In an attempt to associate physiological measurements to the development of diabetes, we decided to include the NHANES Laboratory Dataset which were a part of the main NHANES data source. The Laboratory Dataset included more than 40 different physiological tests which resulted in 13,000+ rows and 338 features. Additionally, we left merged with the diabetes dataset to include the event and time-to-event which added 2 more features resulting in 340 features in the final survival analysis dataset.\nTo investigate the most notable features that have the most significant impact in the development of diabetes, we fitted multiple Cox Proportional Hazards model for each feature from the merged laboratory dataset. We then took the most statistically significant and highly impactful features through given p-values and Hazard Ratios from the fitted Cox models. Finally, we generated Kaplan-Meier survival curves and annotated p-values associated to the relationships of the physiological features and survival time onto each plot.\n\n\n\nThe cleaned laboratory testing data is imported here and further cleaned. We noticed the diabetes dataset that we will use for our time and event included numerous rows of empty values which we replaced with NA here. Additionally, for the sake of cleanliness and efficiency we have decided to replace “yes” and “borderline” values of being diagnosed with type II diabetes to 1 with other values being replaced with 0. Finally, to utilize the diabetes data with our laboratory data we left merged the diabetes dataset with the cleaned laboratory dataset.\n\n\n\nWith more than 300 features in the laboratory data, we decided to sift through them all by fitting univariate Cox Proportional Hazard models on each feature. This will find all features that provide significant impact in time to event. More specifically, we will save the p-value and hazard ratio of each Cox model to a data frame which helps describe the impact of each feature on time-to-event. We then take the top features with the highest statistical significance (lowest p-values) and strongest impact (highest absolute HR values) on the event to do survival analysis.\n\n\n\nThis step takes a look at the top 100 features with the lowest p-values from the saved data frame of extracted p-values and hazard ratio values.

    "text": "Conclusions\nFrom the Kaplan-Meier survival curves done above, only LBDBANO or Basophils number (1000 cell/uL) showed statistically significant difference in the survival analysis between basophils number ranges.\nBasophils are a type of white blood cell and play a key role in protecting the body from infections, cancer cells, parasites, fungi, and allergens. They are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream for a period of time before entering tissues.\nThere was an article about the affects of white blood cell count in inducing type 2 Diabetes. The paper investigates epidemiology studies and found that a raised white blood cell count is associated with a higher risk of type 2 Diabetes. Though it prefaces that there could be publication bias and also a failure to control for all potential confounding factors1."
